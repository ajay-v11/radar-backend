# 🧠 AI Visibility Score – Full Problem Specification

**Goal:** Build a system that measures how visible a brand is across AI model responses for industry-relevant user queries.

---

## 🎯 Problem Overview

Brands have **no idea** how often they are mentioned by AI models when users ask buying-intent or category-relevant questions.  
Traditional SEO doesn't measure AI visibility, so we need an **AI Visibility Score** system.

The system will:

- Detect the brand’s industry
- Generate realistic buyer-intent queries (50–100)
- Test these queries across AI models
- Track whether the brand is mentioned, and who is ranked
- Generate a complete transparent report

---

## Inputs & Outputs

**Input:**

- Company website URL
- Optional: Company name, target region

**Output:**

- Overall visibility score (0-100%)
- Per-model breakdown
- Per-category breakdown
- Competitor rankings
- Complete query log
- Exportable CSV

---

## 🚀 Required Functionality

### **1. Industry Detection**

- Scrape/analyze the brand’s website.
- Extract:
  - Industry
  - Product category
  - Target audience
  - Market keywords
- Derive **search contexts** (e.g., "meal kits", "healthy meal plans", etc.)

---

### **2. Query Generation Engine**

Generate **50–100 industry-specific buyer intent queries**.

Categories:

- **Comparison queries**  
  _“best meal kits for weight loss 2025”_
- **Best-of queries**  
  _“top organic meal delivery services”_
- **How-to queries**  
  _“how to choose a meal delivery service”_
- **Product selection queries**  
  _“meal kits with vegetarian options”_

Requirements:

- Not generic
- Must reflect **real consumer search behavior**

---

### **3. AI Model Testing**

For each query:

- Test it against **at least 2 AI models**
  - ChatGPT
  - Claude
  - Gemini
  - Perplexity
- Store:
  - Did brand appear? (Yes/No)
  - Rank/position in the answer
  - Competitors mentioned
  - Model used
  - Full text of the response (optional but useful)

---

### **4. Analysis & Scoring**

#### **Overall Visibility Score**

Visibility % = (# queries where brand is mentioned / total queries) × 100

#### **Breakdown by Query Type**

Example:
| Query Type | Total | Mentioned | Visibility |
|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Product Selection | 20 | 9 | 45% |
| Comparison | 15 | 3 | 20% |

#### **Competitor Rankings**

Rank competitors based on:

- Frequency of appearance
- Rank positions
- Which query types they dominate

#### **Complete Query Log**

For each query, show:

- Query text
- Brand mentioned? (Yes/No)
- Rank
- Competitors in result
- Model tested

Must show **all queries**, not summaries.
